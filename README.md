# Depecrated
This repos is no being update anymore since Microsft had released a DocumentDB (which now it is called CosmosDB) webclient that doesn't suck.

# ClientDB

A simple multiplatform [DocumentDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/documentdb/) client

Note: this is being made by programmer with no experience with Angular2/(ts|js) so features may take long to be added.

### Roadmap

##### Incoming v0.2.0
Note: it is sill a lot of features to add to this project (like a document viewer, query manager, params manager, etc.) but before I add more feature first I want to make those already added more reliable.

- Better user feedback for action
- Better error handling
- A more organized IPC.
- A reviewed layout (for a better UX)

##### Current v0.1.0

- ~~Get angular 2 set up.~~
- ~~Get Matirial Theme working.~~
- ~~Create form to store connection strings~~
- ~~Create simple shell to exec SQL and get its response.~~
