#ClientDB

A simple DocumentDB client.
It is still at an early development stage.

To get it running you gotta add a host, key and database manually into /view_model/indeViewModel.js file.

`line 14: self.document = new DocumentDB('{host}', '{key}', '{db}')`

I will add a more "elaborated" system for database management soon.
